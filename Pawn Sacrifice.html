            <h2>Boris Spassky</h2>
            <p>
                In Pawn Sacrifice, Boris Spassky, portrayed by Liev Schreiber, is depicted as Bobby Fischerâ€™s formidable Soviet rival and reigning World Chess Champion during their iconic 1972 match. Spassky is shown as a composed, disciplined, and highly respected player, embodying the strength and prestige of Soviet dominance in chess. 
                While outwardly calm and strategic, the film also highlights Spassky's own pressures and the weight of Soviet expectations, as well as his growing concern over Fischer's erratic behavior. Spassky's character serves as both a competitor and a complex figure navigating the political stakes and psychological intensity of their historic rivalry.
