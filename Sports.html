            <h2>Badminton</h2>
            <p>
                Badminton is a fast-paced racket sport played by either two players (singles) or two pairs (doubles) on a rectangular court divided by a net. The objective is to hit a shuttlecock over the net, aiming to land it within the opponent's court while preventing them from returning it. 
                Points are scored when the opposing side fails to return the shuttlecock within bounds. Known for its quick reflexes and agility, badminton requires precision, strategy, and endurance. It is widely played recreationally and competitively worldwide, including in the Olympics.
