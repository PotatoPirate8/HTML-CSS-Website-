                    Brawlhalla is a free-to-play platform fighting game developed by Blue Mammoth Games and published by Ubisoft. Players choose from a roster of diverse characters, called Legends, each with unique weapons and abilities, and battle across various stages. 
                    The gameplay emphasizes fast-paced combat, with mechanics inspired by traditional fighting games and platformers. It supports multiple modes, including 1v1, free-for-all, and ranked matches, both online and offline.
